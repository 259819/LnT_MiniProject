## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. I was Unaware about the badges but Help from  Bharath sir and Prithvi sir on connect sessions help me overcome the issue.
2. I was facing problems in designing the low level diagrams but reference from the other colleagues diagram helped me better understand it.
3. I was getting errors in the unit testing because of different header files so by merging all header files into one single file  helped me solve this issue.
4. Issue with valgrind.
