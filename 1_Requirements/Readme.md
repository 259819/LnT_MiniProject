## Introduction
-Student Record System are often viewed as paperwork produed for the education bureaucracy. However, a well designed automated Student Record System yields many benefits. The most important benefit is the ability to find or report or update information about any individual student within a few seconds. Secondly, the efficiency in processing and exchanging student records among institutes when required becomes very easy.

-Student Record System thus plays a keyrole in the overall functioning of the education system; but more importantly, they increase an institutes ability to meet the needs of a student. In times when there were no computers, maintaining records was quite a labourous task as it used to be on paper and it would take hours and hours of time and would cause lots of paper wastage.

-A computerized Student Record System will eliminate those cumbersome tasks and will improve efficiency by great extent.

## Research
There are 100s and 1000s of student studying in educational institutes and compare to those numbers, the strengh of staff and management is way less. Pen-paper based management of student record is feasible and was in existence in past and is still in practice in some rural areas but with increase in number of youths, it has become very time consuming and labourous task. Records which are maintained for future help becomes a source of stress.

Automated SRS helps to avoid those issues. SRS refers to a number of efficient automated systems designed for recording student data and perform functions like display, modify, delete, update save etc. Some Student Record Systems are made for general purpose while some Student Record System are made for specific purpose like exam performance records,  progress records etc.


**Benefits:**


-Less burden on Staff


-Better management of Records


-reduced wastage of paper


-Time saving

## Defining Our System
   **Assumptions**
   
   Few systems already exists in the network of institutes and other high level  bodies with which our Student Record System will interact.
   
   For example: 
   
   -Student Record and Management Systems of NAAC(NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND ACCREDITATION COUNCIL)
   
   -Student Record and Management Systems of NBA(The National Board of Accreditation)
